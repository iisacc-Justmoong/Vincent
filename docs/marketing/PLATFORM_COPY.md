# Vincent external-platform launch kit

This document contains factual, reusable English copy for Vincent listings on
platforms other than iisacc.com. It must not be changed to claim that a signed
Windows installer is publicly available until a Microsoft Store listing or a
publicly trusted Authenticode-signed release has been verified.

## Canonical facts

- Product: Vincent 5.1
- Current source release: 5.1
- Category: raster drawing, digital paper, handwriting, note-taking
- Platforms: Windows, macOS, and Linux source/build support
- License: GNU AGPLv3
- Price: commercial Vincent license sold through iisacc.com; source available under GNU AGPLv3
- Privacy: account email and license key are used only for online license validation and a user-requested update grant; opening Preferences may explicitly read the stored email for an email-only fixed display. There is no telemetry, analytics, advertising, cloud document upload, remote polling, or automatic/background update check. When the user-controlled nearby-discovery setting is enabled, Vincent exchanges an ephemeral anonymous presence heartbeat only within the current LAN; it includes no profile, account, device name, or document data, only an invitation-capability Boolean and a temporary TCP port while the user explicitly shares a canvas. Selecting an opted-in nearby user from Members sends that target a one-hop invitation containing the inviter's profile name and temporary canvas endpoint. Acceptance or an explicit join transfers profile names and the complete canvas snapshot directly over the LAN without an Internet relay

## Tagline

Private, local-first digital paper for focused drawing.

## Short description

Vincent is a local-first raster drawing app for focused drawing, handwriting,
layered editing, and PSD-compatible workflows. A purchased iisacc account
license unlocks the canvas through online verification, while documents remain
local with no telemetry, advertising, remote polling, or automatic update
checks. An optional anonymous one-hop local-network heartbeat detects other
nearby Vincent devices without sending profile, account, device-name, or
document data. Users can explicitly share or join a canvas, or invite a
specifically selected opted-in nearby user. Only that explicit invitation adds
the inviter's profile name and endpoint; accepted sessions transfer profile
names and canvas snapshots directly between the participating LAN devices
without a cloud relay.

## Directory summary

Vincent 5.1 is a Qt 6 desktop raster editor for drawing, handwriting, layered
canvas work, and PSD-compatible import and export. Its local-first design keeps
documents on the user's device; the app sends account-license credentials only
for activation and a user-requested update, with no telemetry, advertising, or
automatic update checks. Its user-controlled one-hop LAN presence heartbeat is
anonymous and contains no profile, account, device-name, or document data, only
an invitation-capability Boolean and a temporary port while canvas sharing is
active. A specifically targeted invitation adds the inviter's profile name only
after a Members `+` selection; canvas and participant data move only after
acceptance or explicit share/join actions and remain direct between participating
LAN devices.
The source is available under GNU AGPLv3.
A publicly trusted Windows package is in preparation.

## Product Hunt description

Vincent is a local-first raster drawing app for handwriting, layered artwork,
and PSD-compatible workflows. A purchased license is checked online while
documents stay on the device with no telemetry or ads. AGPLv3 source is
available now; an optional anonymous one-hop LAN beacon can detect another nearby
Vincent device, and a signed Windows release is in preparation.

## First launch comment

I built Vincent because a drawing surface should feel like paper, not a
service. It is a native Qt 6 desktop application with pressure-aware brushes,
layers, shapes, text, image import, and PSD-compatible workflows. Documents
stay local. Vincent uses the purchaser's iisacc account email and license key
only for activation or a user-requested update, and has no telemetry, advertising, or automatic update checks.
Nearby Vincent discovery is confined to an anonymous one-hop LAN heartbeat and
contains no profile, account, device-name, or document data, only an invitation
capability and a temporary port while canvas sharing is active. Selecting an
opted-in nearby user can send that target the inviter's profile name and endpoint;
accepted or explicitly joined devices exchange profile names and canvas snapshots
directly over that LAN, without a cloud relay.

Version 5.1 is available as complete AGPLv3 source. We are currently
preparing the publicly trusted Windows distribution and would especially value
feedback from artists, pen-tablet users, Qt developers, and Windows testers.

## Suggested tags

- Drawing
- Digital Art
- Handwriting
- Note-taking
- Open Source
- Privacy
- Raster Graphics
- Qt
- Windows

## Suggested alternatives

When a platform requests comparable products, use only products that share the
same primary workflow:

- Krita
- MyPaint
- Microsoft Paint
- Paint.NET
- Sketchbook

Do not describe Vincent as a complete replacement for these products. Present
it as a focused, local-first alternative.

## Asset inventory

- `vincent-windows-editor.png`: verified screenshot of the running Windows
  application, suitable as the primary gallery image.
- `vincent-sample-artwork.png`: generated demonstration artwork opened in the
  application screenshot. Use it only as a secondary example image and never
  present it as application UI.

## Availability wording

Use this sentence until a trusted installer is public:

> Complete source is available now. A publicly trusted Windows installer is
> in preparation and development-only self-signed packages are not
> distributed.

After a trusted release is verified, replace the sentence with a direct
platform download link and the exact verified publisher identity. Do not
promise that Microsoft Defender SmartScreen will never warn because reputation
is evaluated separately from Authenticode validity.
